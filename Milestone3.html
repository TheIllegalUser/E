    <h1>The Xbox 1</h1>
    <p class=three>
        The <i>Xbox 1</i> was the third installation in the Xbox Series, and was branded as a "starting over" 
        instead of the theorised Xbox 720. Over all the Xbox one boasted much better graphics than its previous
        console, and they even believed it could rival the mega giant which was the PS4, however there was a
        small problem with the <i>xbox 1</i>. Its ability to play games live had a price tag, something the PS4 didnt, 
        so many people ended up opting for the PS4. unfortunatly for xbox too, they presented their console first,
        at a $500 price tag, and later that night, SONY, creaters of the PS4, revealed that their console would be
        $400 and have free access to live games. after that announcemenet, Xbox said they would change some of the 
        online requirments and fees. Overall though, the Xbox was found to be slightly better in terms of hardware,  
        with a stronger system overall. The Xbox also boasted HDR support and 4K blue-ray player. The xbox one 
        also hosted Kinect 2.0, which was a motion sensor that allowed you to play games that required more than 
        pressing and moving buttons on a controller. This, however, was removed from the Xbox bundle, which was not 
        originally the plan, as Microsoft wanted people to first have the Xbox, and then ramp it up to the Kinect
        when they had the money. One of the features that other Xbox consoles had too was backwards compactability.
        You were able to play older games on the newer consoles if it was possible. this allowed Some more nostalgic
        players to relive some of the older games, although support for live was mostly limited.
