    <h1>A Good and Bad Situation, cross platform</h1>
    <p class= four> Microsoft offered a <i>game pass</i> that you could renew at a set time for access to content. this content 
        included a large list of games, as well as movies and other smaller features. Now the thing with the 
        gamepass was that you could use this on computers and other devices, and thus, you could play microsoft 
        games on other devices and not just the Xbox. While this was great for the customer, as they could be 
        flexable and not be locked on their device, in terms of sales, Xbox was always lower than PS4 because 
        some people opted to not use the Xbox, along with the fact that the PS4 was overall rated to be better
        and more reliable, considering its competitions previous xbox was infamous for its red ring of death.
        With all this however, Microsoft made a neat addition to possibly buffer their profits, which was 
        cross platform playing, enabling PC users to play with Xbox users. One of the better things about This
        for the user however, was the ability to have one microsoft account for everything. This did make it alot 
        easier for users overall, and prevented some hassles and multiple accounts that other users would of needed.
        One of the strongest standing parts of the Xbox <i>game pass</i> was Halo, included in the <i>game pass</i>, this game had 
        been an iconic symbol of Xbox, being exlusive only to them. It had carried the ealier consoles in terms of content,
        and was one of the larger reasons as to why many gamers chose the Xbox. throughout its life the Xbox continued
        to maintain its main game as a symbol of Xbox, and added it to the gamepass.
