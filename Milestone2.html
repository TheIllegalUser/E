    <h1>The Xbox 360</h1>
    <p class=two>
        The <i>Xbox 360</i> was the next released version of the Xbox. this new and upgraded version sold 84M
        consoles, but it was famous for a fatal problem. Many gamers who used the xbox <i>360</i> are familiar 
        with the red ring of death. when the xbox encountered a fatal software problem, it was completely
        lock and shut down, leaving only a red ring to show users that it had encountered a problem.
        Xbox had to extend its warranty and fix many xbox's in order to counter this, which was not good. 
        Other than this, it was a relative sucess, and they even developed a kinect peice for it for live
        motion gaming. In addition to the previous console, the <i>360</i> offered an HDMI cable, S/PDIF, Sterio audio,
        Composite audio, and other places to plug stuff in for usage. in terms of sales, it did relatively well 
        across the world, and was even considered to have build a solid foundation in the gaming industry due to 
        its incredible sales. Other companies such as Nintendo had their consoled however, such as the Wii, 
        which was a huge success, selling more units that the Xbox, however, their sales later diminished due 
        to the Wii U, which was considered a flop. Due to the presence of the Wii however, Xbox failed to launch
        well in Japan. The PS3 failed considerably in sales, since it lacked any quality games. a few games that it
        had planned to sell as exlusive also failed, as Xbox managed to aquire them too.
