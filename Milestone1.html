    <h1>The Beginning of the Xbox</h1>
        <p class = one>The <i>Xbox</i> started out when a group of designers came to Bill Gates asking if
            they could release a hardware device made just for gaming. Bill Gates agreed,
            since Microsoft wanted a stake in the newly rising gaming industry, that was
            primarily controlled by the playstation 2, the proposed "<i>xbox</i>" would have almost 
            double the hardware capabilities of the PS2, and would help solidify <i>xbox</i> in 
            the gaming market. Upon release, <i>xbox</i> was an instant success in America. In that
            time, Microsoft made one of the best decisions for the companies future, which was 
            to buy Bungie, a game company that had created halo. Upon release to the <i>Xbox</i> as 
            a first person game, it became an instant success. Halo was by far one of the most popular
            games on the <i>Xbox</i> exlusively, and helped build its brand. At a $299 price tag, over
            1 million consoles were sold, which was groundbreaking back then. the specs of the first<i>Xbox</i> were:
            CPU: Intel Pentium running at 733 MHz. 64 MB memory, 8GB internam HDD, 8MB memory card, and other
            smaller features. The controller for the <i>xbox</i> was a bit infamous for being too large, winning a 
            blunder of the year by guinness world record for its size, and second worst controller. Where <i>Xbox</i>
            tried really hard to sell in was Japan, an econonmy that was dominated by Nintendo. Although they 
            offered a well recieved console in other parts of the world, it struggled to sell in Japan, and
            ended up not being profitable for them. additionally to that, the country was more well recieved to 
            smaller products.
